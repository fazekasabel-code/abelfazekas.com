# abelfazekas.com — TODO

## Before publishing (day or two)

- [ ] **BIO: namedropping on/off toggle** — About page: add toggle to show/hide institutional affiliations and collaborator names (e.g. in long bio/education). Optionally short bio variant without name-drops.
- [ ] **Setup for deployment** — Choose host (Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages), connect repo or upload, point abelfazekas.com DNS to it. Document steps for future updates.
- [ ] **Set up hello@abelfazekas.com** — Create mailbox/alias and point contact page to the working address.
- [ ] **Final proofread** — Pass over all copy (bios, work descriptions, agenda, contact) for typos and consistency.
- [ ] **Test on real devices** — Mobile nav, home scroll, work filters and expand/collapse, all pages. Check one narrow viewport and one desktop.
- [ ] **Check links** — Every external href (YouTube, Bandcamp, 6szin, hangzavart.com, contact, etc.) opens correctly and is appropriate (no broken or placeholder URLs).
- [ ] **Media** — Confirm hero image and any other assets load; consider lazy-loading or sizing if needed.

## After publishing

- [ ] **Announce** — Share link where you want (social, email, etc.).
- [ ] **Monitor** — Spot-check live site for a few days (redirects, mixed content, console errors if any).
- [ ] **Iterate** — Add BIO namedropping toggle and any small copy/design tweaks from feedback.

## Later (optional)

- [ ] CV download link (About).
- [ ] Analytics: yes/no; if yes, privacy-respecting (e.g. Plausible).
- [ ] Multilingual (EN / HU / FR?) if desired.
- [ ] Make and upload music score previews for selected works.
