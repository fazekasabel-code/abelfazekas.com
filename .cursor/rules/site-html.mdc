# abelfazekas.com HTML / UX conventions

- **Single-page app structure**
  - Keep the site as one HTML file (`site_v7.html`) with multiple page sections (`.pg` containers) switched by the `go(name)` function.
  - Reuse the shared mobile navigation overlay and JavaScript helpers when adding new sections.

- **Styling**
  - Use Tailwind utility classes plus the existing small custom CSS layer at the top of the file.
  - Prefer extending existing patterns (e.g. `warm-body`, `agenda-body`, `work-entry`, `work-tag`) instead of inventing new ad‑hoc styles.
  - Keep typography in the existing monospace families; avoid mixing in new font families unless there is a strong reason.

- **Interaction patterns**
  - For expandable/collapsible content (e.g. works list), follow the `work-header` + `work-detail-wrap` / `work-detail-inner` pattern so animations and icons stay consistent.
  - For filters, reuse the `.filter-cb` and `.filter-label` pattern and update the count indicator / “no results” states as in the current Works page.
  - When adding new pages that need nav items, wire them into both the desktop nav bars and the shared mobile overlay.

- **Content & accessibility**
  - Maintain the tone and voice used in the current bios and work descriptions; edits should keep the same level of precision and concreteness.
  - Always set `alt` text on new images and use descriptive link text (not just “here”).
  - Keep the “no tracking / no data collection” stance explicit in the footer.

- **Meta / SEO**
  - Keep meta description and Open Graph tags aligned with how you currently describe your practice; if the core tagline changes, update these in one place at the top of the document.
